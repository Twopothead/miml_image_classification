\noindent\textbf{Abstract: }
Deep Neural Network has recently achieved outstanding performance in a variety of computer 
vision tasks,especially classification related tasks,including multi-class classification 
 and multi-label classification.In multi-label classification problems, an image is associated 
 with a set of labels simultaneously.
Due to our very limited compute resources and little money,it is almost impossible to 
build and train a powerful image classification model totally from zero.
However,by storing knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different
but related problem, better results can be obtained, and this strategy is called transfer learning. 
ResNet-50(deep Residual Networks) is a powerful residual learning framework,
these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from 
considerably increased depth. Build and train a model with very little data 
and still yield reasonable results is feasible with transfer learning and pre-trained
models, namely ResNet-50.
Building on prior work in this field, we do transfer learning with and without fine-tuning 
as well as the training of a neural network model from scratch on a much smaller 
multi-label image dataset.This multi-label image dataset is provided by NJU LAMDA,this dataset 
contains 2000 natural scenes images.

To address the above problem,we propose a novel deep transfer neural network based on 
multi-label learning for classification tasks.The existing approaches tend to treat multi-label problems as those for multi-class 
problems.Our model mainly consists of two sub-networks: the transfer learning network and the multi-label learning network.
The transfer neural network is an extended ResNet-50 architecture.
In data pre-processing stage, we convert 2000 images and their labels into tfrecord format(
native file format used in Tensorflow allows programmers to shuffle, batch and split datasets with its 
own functions).we shuffle and augment data,this helps prevent overfitting and help the 
model generalize better. We use the bottleneck features of a pre-trained network, namely ResNet50, 
which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.Because the ImageNet dataset contains several nature scene classes
, such as 'tree','desert','sea' and so on among its total of 1000 classes, this base model will
already have learned features that are relevant to our multi-label classification problem under 
natural scene. To further improve this base model's (pre-trained Resnet model) performance,
we 'fine-tune' the last convolutional block of the ResNet model as well as the top-level classifier.
Our experimentations with real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Here we will simply introduce two neural network libraries that we used :TensorFlow and Keras.
TensorFlow™ is an open source software library for high performance numerical computation. 
Its flexible architecture allows easy deployment of computation across a variety of platforms.
Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python 
and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling 
fast experimentation. Keras enable us to go from idea to result with the least possible delay.
